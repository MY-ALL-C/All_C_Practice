#Topic 2        ::      C - Data Types











__________________________________
#1 C - Program Structure ::

A C program basically consists of the following parts :
    - Preprocessor Commands
    - Functions
    - Variables
    - Statements & Expressions
    - Comments

#include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.

Tokens in C :
A C program consists of various tokens.
A token is can be an identifier, a keyword, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol.

Identifier In C :
An Identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.
C is a case-sensitive programming language.


Keywords in C :
The following is a list of keywords available with c
auto        else        long        switch
break       enum        register	typedef
case        extern      return      union
char        float       short       unsigned
const       for         signed      void
continue    goto        sizeof      volatile
default     if          static      while
do          int         struct      _Packed
double			

rerely used keywords :: register, volatile, _Packed
Tips :: Try to learn the uses of {enum} keyword in coding


Whitespace In C :
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments.
Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins
