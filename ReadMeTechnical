__________________________________
#1 C Program Structure ::

A C program basically consists of the following parts :
    - Preprocessor Commands
    - Functions
    - Variables
    - Statements & Expressions
    - Comments

#include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.
int main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
The next line return 0; terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.

Tokens in C :
A C program consists of various tokens.
A token is can be an identifier, a keyword, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol.


An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).

C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language.
